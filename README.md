# Strong Password Generator

## Overview
The **Strong Password Generator** is a React-based web application that allows users to generate secure, random passwords. Users can customize their passwords by choosing the length and including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The application also provides an option to copy the generated password to the clipboard and send it privately via email or SMS.

## Features
- **Generate Secure Passwords**: Randomly generates strong passwords based on user-selected criteria.
- **Customizable Password Options**: Allows users to set password length and include/exclude uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Easily copy the generated password to your clipboard.
- **Email/SMS Option**: Send the generated password via email or SMS securely.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
- **ReactJS**: Frontend framework to build the user interface.
- **CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **EmailJS**: Service for sending password via email.
- **Twilio API**: Service for sending password via SMS (Node.js backend required for SMS functionality).

### EmailJS
1. Create an account on [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/).
2. Set up a service and create an email template.
3. Replace the `YOUR_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY` with your actual public key in the code.

### Twilio (for SMS)
1. Sign up for a Twilio account on [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/).
2. Get your **Account SID**, **Auth Token**, and **Twilio Phone Number**.
3. Set up a simple backend with Node.js to handle the SMS sending (as described in the Node.js backend section).
4. Replace the backend URL in the front-end code with your actual endpoint.

## Key Components

### `App.js`
This is the main component that handles the rendering of the password generator form, password options, and displays the generated password.

### `PasswordGenerator.js`
This component contains the logic for generating passwords based on user input. It handles password length, character set options, and updates the state accordingly.

### `PasswordOptions.js`
This component allows users to customize their password generation criteria by selecting checkboxes for uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It also includes a slider to adjust the password length.

### `App.css`
Contains the styling for the entire application, including layout, color scheme, and responsiveness.

## Usage

1. **Generate Password**: Select password length and criteria (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) and click "Generate Password" to generate a secure password.
2. **Copy to Clipboard**: Click the "Copy" button to copy the generated password to your clipboard.
3. **Send Password Privately**: Select the "Email" or "SMS" option to send the generated password to a specified email address or phone number. Enter the email address or phone number, and the password will be sent securely.
